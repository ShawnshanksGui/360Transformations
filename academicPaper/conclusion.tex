\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented in this paper viewport-adaptive streaming for
navigable 360-degree videos. We have studied certain key parameter settings,
which result in quality increase for a given bit-rate budget. This
paper highlights various exciting open questions, including: $(i)$ new
adaptation algorithms should be studied for viewport navigation,
especially based on \emph{saliency maps} for 360-degree videos. $(ii)$
new video encoding methods should be developed to perform
quality-differentiated encoding for large-resolution videos. $(iii)$
new delivery mechanisms should be developed for the special
case of ultra-wide-band wireless transmission at home.
