\section{Introduction}

The popularity of navigable 360-degree video systems has grown with the advent of both capturing systems (including multi-camera with stitching systems) and interactive entertaining systems (including head-mounted display devices). However, the delivery of 360-degree video content, from servers to the end-users, is still a challenge.

360-degree videos that are used in head mounted displays have large resolution and frame rate, thus resulting in very large file sizes. However, a viewer sees only a part of the video at a given time, based on the device viewing angle (i.e., Field of View (FoV)) that determines how long and wide the displayed picture is seen by the viewer. The viewing angle, measured horizontally or vertically from the head center, scales from 60-150 degrees for most of the currently available HMP devices. For a HMD device to display a FoV in full HD quality (1280x1080) to a viewer, it needs to deliver a 360-degree video in 3-6 times higher resolution (i.e., at least 4k at 3840x2160). Delivery of such videos with 35-68 Mbps bitrate to end users over the existing network infrastructure is quite challenging, requiring a significant increase of the Internet connection speed (from the currently used 5 Mbps for 720p content).

What do existing 360 video delivery systems do, are they solving this task? Is this extensively studied or is this field at the beginning?

What are the key questions that we intend to answer in this paper? How do our questions differ from the existing literature?

How do we answer these questions and bridge the gap in 360-degree video delivery? (What is the impact/scale of measurements/experiments/dataset compared to existing frameworks?)

What are our answers to these questions (observations)?

What are main contributions of our work?

Organization of the paper.
