  title = {Compressed domain video processing for tile based panoramic streaming using {{HEVC}}},
  abstract = {Panoramic streaming is a particular way of video streaming where an arbitrary Region-of-Interest (RoI) of high-spatial resolution videos is transmitted. It allows users to navigate interactively around the video and thus select anytime the portion of it they are interested in. The most basic approach consists of each user interacting with the system indicating the desired RoI. Then an encoder associated with each user encodes the desired RoI. However, such a system does not scale well. Instead, we consider tile based panoramic streaming, where users receive a set of tiles that match their RoI, and propose a low-complexity compressed domain video processing technique for tile based panoramic streaming using H.265/HEVC that generates a single video bitstream out of the selected tiles so that single hardware decoders can be used to decode the RoI video stream.},

  title = {Mixing {{Tile Resolutions}} in {{Tiled Video}}: {{A Perceptual Quality Assessment}}},
  abstract = {The mismatch between increasingly large video resolution and constrained screen size of mobile devices has led to the proposal of zoomable video systems based on tiled video. In the current system, a tiled video frame is constructed from multiple tiles in a single resolution stream. In this paper, we explore the perceptual effect of mixed-resolution tiles in tiled video, in which tiles within a video frame could come from streams with different resolutions, with the aim to tradeoff bandwidth and perceptual video quality. To understand how users perceive the video quality of mixed-resolution tiled video, we conducted a psychophysical study with 50 participants on tiled videos where the tile resolutions are randomly chosen from two resolution levels with equal probability. The experiment results show that in many cases, we can mix tiles from HD (1920×1080p) stream and tiles from 1600×900p stream without being noticed by the viewers. Even when participants notice quality degradation in videos combined with tiles from HD stream and tiles from 960×540p stream, the majority of participants still accept the degradation when viewing videos with low and medium motion; and greater than 40\% of participants accept the quality degradation when viewing video with dense motion.},

This system makes it possible for users to watch video content wherever they want to watch it by using interactive streaming technology that selectively streams the user's watching section at a high bitrate in a limited network bandwidth. Applying this technology to omnidirectional video allows users to experience feelings of presence through the use of an intuitive head mount display. The system has also been released on a commercial platform and successfully streamed a real-time event. A demonstration is planned in which the details of the system and the streaming service results obtained with it will be presented.},

  abstract = {Video communication is often afflicted by various forms of losses, such as packet loss over the Internet. The paper examines the question of whether the packet loss pattern, and in particular the burst length, is important for accurately estimating the expected mean-squared error distortion. Specifically, we (1) verify that the loss pattern does have a significant effect on the resulting distortion, (2) explain why a loss pattern, for example a burst loss, generally produces a larger distortion than an equal number of isolated losses, and (3) propose a model that accurately estimates the expected distortion by explicitly accounting for the loss pattern, inter-frame error propagation, and the correlation between error frames. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated with JVT/H.26L coded video and previous frame concealment, where for most sequences the total distortion is predicted to within \ensuremath{\pm}0.3 dB for burst loss of length two packets, as compared to prior models which underestimate the distortion by about 1.5 dB. Furthermore, as the burst length increases, our prediction is within \ensuremath{\pm}0.7 dB, while prior models degrade and underestimate the distortion by over 3 dB.},
